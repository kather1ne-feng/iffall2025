    <h3>How to make miso soup</h3>
    <p>this is a basic recipe for miso soup that can be your blank canvas 
        for anything you can dream of adding: mushrooms, fried tofu, claims, chicken, sake, mirin, or even butter.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <p>yields 4 servings</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 5in square kombu (dried kelp)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>
        <li>5 grams wakame (dried seaweed), crushed (1/4 cup)</li>
        <li>2 cups loosely packed katsuobushi (bonito flakes)</li>
        <li>1 14ounce package silken tofu, drained</li>
        <li>1/4 cup miso (red or white: see more), plus more to taste</li>
        <li>* miso note: white/shiro miso is made with a higher proportion of rice to soybeans which has a milder sweeter flavor. red/aka miso is made with more soybeans with a bolder more umami-rich taste (and darker color). both are good but have different flavor profiles as a heads up for your soup.</li>
        <li>1 large scallion, thinly sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>make dashi, the soup base:</li>
        <li>soak kombu in 4 cups cold water for 15 min in a medium pot.</li>
        <li>add sake and mirin and bring the pot to a simmer on high heat</li>
        <li>take pot off of the heat just as water starts to boil, and cover for 15 min</li>
        <li>when ready to serve:</li>
        <li>remove kombu from pot. * you can discard the kombu or slice thinly into stricts to add to pasta, soup, stews, and salads. kelp is one of the most nutrient dense seaweeds</li>
        <li>stir the katsubushi into the broth and cover to steep for 1 min</li>
        <li>strain into a medium bowl and press the katsubushi to extract all the liquid and discard the flakes</li>
        
        <li>while waiting on the dashi, soak wakame in a small bowl of water for 15 minutes or until soft</li>
        <li>drain wakame and set aside</li>

        <li>put the dashi in the pot and added the drained wakmame</li>
        <li>scoop the tofu into the pot with a spoon or your hand, leaving it in large chunks</li>
        <li>bring the soup to a boil then remove from heat</li>

        <li>add miso to a small bowl, and ladle some broth over to stir and dissolve the miso</li>
        <li>add the dissolved miso mixture to the pot and stir gently until incorporated</li>
        <li>add the scallion and seasoning by taste</li>
        <li>serve immediately</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>nonrecipe websites</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/menu/">https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/menu/</a> every section has a border so everything seems organized and easy to navigate which you always need
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.farmspiritstl.com">https://www.farmspiritstl.com</a> I had a burger from this place this weekend and it was really good so i just looked it up but i like that there is a very cohesive theme on the website that fits with their brand so i want to try to use colors and fonts with my recipe that matches the vibe of soup
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://store.moma.org/">https://store.moma.org/</a> I like the font and that it displys a lot of different featured objects that you can buy bc i feel like it really sells the point so hopefully i can try to do that with miso soup lets go
