    </li>
    <li>
      equipment needed: medium pot, 1-2 small bowls, ladle, spoon
    </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Ingredients:</h4>
    <ul>
      <p><em>to make dashi (soup base):</em></p>
        <li>1 5in square kombu (dried kelp)</li>
                <li>2 cups loosely packed katsuobushi (bonito flakes)</li>
                        <li>1 tablespoon sake</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon mirin</li>

      <p><em>toppings/add-ins:</em></p>

        <li>1 14ounce package silken tofu, drained</li>
        <li>1/4 cup miso (red or white: see more), plus more to taste</li>
        <p><em>* miso note: white/shiro miso is made with a higher proportion of rice to soybeans which has a milder sweeter flavor. red/aka miso is made with more soybeans with a bolder more umami-rich taste (and darker color). both are good but have different flavor profiles as a heads up for your soup.</em></p> 
        <li>1 large scallion, thinly sliced</li>

       
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
      <p><em>to make dashi</em></p>

        <li>add sake and mirin and bring the pot to a simmer on high heat</li>

        <li><a href="https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-lemon-zucchini-pasta">https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/creamy-lemon-zucchini-pasta:</a> I like that this recipe website has a scrolling section of all the supplies that you need. I feel like it can be confusing and messy when you gather the kitchen supplies in the middle of cooking so this is helpful.</li>

    <h2>nonrecipe websites</h2>
    <ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/menu/">https://vanleeuwenicecream.com/menu/</a> every section has a border so everything seems organized and easy to navigate which you always need
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://www.farmspiritstl.com">https://www.farmspiritstl.com</a> I had a burger from this place this weekend and it was really good so i just looked it up but i like that there is a very cohesive theme on the website that fits with their brand so i want to try to use colors and fonts with my recipe that matches the vibe of soup
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://store.moma.org/">https://store.moma.org/</a> I like the font and that it displys a lot of different featured objects that you can buy bc i feel like it really sells the point so hopefully i can try to do that with miso soup lets go
